### Project Description

**Research Project Purpose:**

The purpose of our project is to examine the ways in which COVID-19 and the pandemic has affected the health of individuals in the United States. We will analyze data from the CDC and various other resources that provide us data on the rate of COVID-19 cases and the reported signs/symptoms of various mental health disorders such as depression and anxeity. The question we hope to answer is: to what extend has COVID-19 impacted the mental health of adults in the Unites States?

**Research Summary:**

When it comes to research on this topic, most other works have found that the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdowns have greatly negatively affected people. One study by the National Institute of Mental Health covers the first year in COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health status of people and they found that most people’s mental health has deteriorated through the pandemic. Another study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that substance abuse has risen through the pandemic. Our project will consider this along with other implications found in our data that have risen from the pandemic.

**Dataset:**

The datasets that we found and have chosen to use for our project are “**Indicators of Anxiety or Depression Based on Reported Frequency of Symptoms During Last 7 Days**” and “**Reddit Mental Health Dataset**”. 

The first dataset from the CDC was collected from the U.S. Census Bureau, who launched a Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households. This survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness. This dataset is accessible through the CDC’s website and displays the columns used in the dataframe.

The Reddit Mental Health Dataset contains posts from 28 subreddits (15 mental health support groups) from 2018-2020. This dataset is accessible on Zendo.org and was collected from an observational study that used natural language processing to reveal vulnerable mental health support groups and heightened health anxiety on Reddit during Covid-19. 

**Target Audience:**

Who is your target audience? Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences. 

- Our target audience are individuals who know someone or are personally suffering from mental health disorders

What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)

- Our project can bring awareness to our audience about the effects that COVID-19 poses on mental health. Our research will also provide resources to the audience to cope with mental stress due to the pandemic. Our project also hopes to promote empathy and to emphasis the importance of supporting those who are struggling especially due to the circumstances created by the pandemic.

### Technical Description

What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?

- Shiny 

Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges? 

- Data cleaning probably will take time Still in process of looking for appropriate datasets 

What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?

- May need to revisit Shiny app and HTMLWhat major challenges do you anticipate?
